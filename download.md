# Download

Media Sidekick requires video codecs in order to play videos. For Windows users, if this is not the case, please install a codec package like [K-Lite](http://www.codecguide.com/download_k-lite_codec_pack_basic.htm) first.

Found a bug, have an idea or a future requirement, please add them on the [Issue tool on github](https://github.com/ewoudwijma/MediaSidekick/issues).

Media Sidekick is currently “low profile” as at is still in it’s early stage of development. See the [Roadmap](roadmap.md) for future plans. Around version 1.0.0 more marketing will be done.
