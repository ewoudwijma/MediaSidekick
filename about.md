# About

Media Sidekick is a free desktop application aimed at minimizing the time between shooting and publishing videos. Media Sidekick prepares raw video for efficient editing in your preferred video editor. Media Sidekick is tuned for action camera footage having a lot of raw video which needs to compressed to a small video showing the best of it.

Using Media Sidekick speeds up the process as the generated video editor project files contain a maximum of preset values (e.g. timelines with transitions and effects), eliminating repeating manual work as much as possible.

Media Sidekick can generate previews in seconds, allowing you to quickly evaluate and adjust clips. Previews are saved as files and can be played by normal video players.

Media Sidekick is vendor independent by using exif data and subtitle files (.srt) to store clip information. This allows you to change your video editor always, reuse old clips and use common video players and video managers to show what Media Sidekick has produced.

Media Sidekick looks similar to a conventional video editor. Differences are:

# A folder is a playlist, no need to create your own playlist
# Does not support effects and transitions, only defines a preset for it which will show up in your video editor
# No editing in the timeline, the timeline is auto-generated in real time.
# Better support for file and metadata management

Typical process

# Rename and trim video files
# Create clips
# Rate, tag, reorder, remove alikes and filtering of clips
# Fine tune the timeline by filtering clips and adding a transition
# Export previews (lossless or encoded)
# Export video editor project file

What remains to be done in a conventional video editor is:

# Nothing if you are satisfied with the results created by Media Sidekick
# Export to desired output format or upload to YouTube or other platforms
# Fine tune clips and transitions
# Add filters and or tune filters
# Add additional video or audio tracks
# â€¦
